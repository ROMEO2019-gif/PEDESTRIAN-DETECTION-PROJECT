This project presents the development and assessment of an intelligent pedestrian detection system. It involves a systematic comparison between traditional computer vision technique, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and an advanced deep learning model, YOLOv5n, a light variant of YOLOv5. The system is tested using publicly available KITTI dataset across challenging scenarios such as occlusion, changing lighting conditions, and diverse pedestrian behaviors. The results reveal that deep learning models outperform traditional methods in both accuracy and reliability, establishing a strong foundation for a real-time pedestrian detection system that greatly improves autonomous vehicle decision-making and overall traffic safety. Evaluation at 52 epochs, the fine-tuned YOLOv5 model obtained a Precision of 89.5%, a Recall of 61.6%, an mAp@0.5 of 73.9% and an mAP@0.5-0.95 of 44.5 %( Better than pertained values of 34.3). The fine-tuned model posted 75.99 m/s at Inference (Comparable to the obtained at full training of 73.6m/s on the COCO dataset). The test on a real-world video of downtown Kampala street junction had remarkable detection of pedestrians in the foreground.
